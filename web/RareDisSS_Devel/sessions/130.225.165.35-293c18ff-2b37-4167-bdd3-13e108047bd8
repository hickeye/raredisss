aS'Megaloblastic Anemia Sunday, 31 August 2003 Last Updated Monday, 12 January 2004 What The general definition of anemia is a blood disorder in which the number of red blood cells (RBC) or the amount of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body, is below normal. Megaloblastic Anemia is a general term describing anemias characterized by the presence of large, structurally and visually abnormal, immature red blood cells (megaloblasts). Deficiency or defective absorption of folate or vitamin B12 (cobalamin) may cause this type of anemia in 95% of the cases of megaloblastic anemia. However, there are other rare causes of this disease in the remaining 5% of affected individuals, such as Diamond-Blackfan, congenital dyserythropoetic anemias, and other inherited defects. White blood cells (leukocytes) and platelets (the blood cell which helps to stop bleeding) may also be present in low numbers. Who Vitamin B12 deficiency: B12 is not produced in the body so it must be provided in the diet. Therefore, if a person does not have enough oral intake of B12 in foods, he/she will become deficient in this vitamin and can develop megaloblastic anemia. Vitamin B12 is not found in plants and therefore strict vegetarians (vegans) who eat no dairy/ animal products are at risk for developing B12 deficiency. Breast feeding infants of vegan mothers are also at risk for developing megaloblastic anemia because of low levels of vitamin B12 in the breast milk. Folate deficiency: Folate is found in many foods but the foods with the highest folate levels are orange juice, spinach and liver. Overcooking vegetables can result in the loss of folate from those foods. Cereals and breads can have high folate levels. Human milk contains sufficient folate to prevent an infant from developing folate deficiency. It is important to remember that goats milk is one food that contains very little folate or B12, so if an infant or child is given only this type of milk, he/...'

aS'Fanconi anemia, also known as aplastic anemia with congenital anomalies, is a rare genetic disorder that may be apparent at birth or during childhood. In some cases, Fanconi anemia might not be diagnosed until adulthood. It is an inherited predisposition to gene mutations, probably because of a poor ability to repair chromosome damage (chromosome instability). It predisposes to damage to stem cells and eventually to leukemic transformation. The disorder is characterized by a deficiency of all bone marrow elements including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets (pancytopenia). Fanconi anemia may also be associated with heart (cardiac), kidney (renal), and/or skeletal abnormalities. It is commonly accompanied by patchy, brown discolorations (pigmentation changes) of the skin. There are several different subtypes (complementation groups) of Fanconi anemia, each of which is thought to result from an abnormal change (mutation) to a different gene. Each subtype appears to share the same characteristic symptoms and findings (phenotype). Most cases of Fanconi anemia have autosomal recessive inheritance. Fanconi anemia is not related in any way to Fanconi syndrome, a rare kidney disorder.'

aS'In aplastic anemia (AA), the bone marrow stops making enough red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Aplastic anemia may appear at any age, but is diagnosed more often in children and young adults. The disorder occurs in about 2-6 individuals per million population worldwide. About 20% of individuals develop aplastic anemia as part of an inherited syndrome such as Fanconi anemia, dyskeratosis congenita, or Blackfan Diamond anemia. Most individuals (80%) have acquired aplastic anemia, meaning that it was caused by infections such as hepatitis or Epstein-Barr virus, toxic exposure to radiation and chemicals, or drugs such as chloramphenical or phenylbutazone. Research suggests aplastic anemia may be the result of an autoimmune disorder. Symptoms The symptoms of aplastic anemia come on slowly. The symptoms are related to the low levels of blood cells: Low numbers of red blood cells causes anemia, with symptoms such as headache, dizziness, fatigue, and paleness (pallor) Low numbers of platelets (necessary for blood clotting) causes unusual bleeding from the gums, nose, or bruising under the skin (small spots called petechiae) Low numbers of white blood cells (necessary for fighting infection) causes recurrent infections or lingering illness. Diagnosis The symptoms of aplastic anemia often point the way to diagnosis. The physician will obtain a complete blood cell count (CBC) and the blood will be examined under the microscope (blood smear). The CBC will show the low levels of red cells, white cells, and platelets in the blood. Looking at the cells under the microscope will distinguish aplastic anemia from other blood disorders. In addition to the blood tests, a bone marrow biopsy (sample) will be taken and examined under the microscope. In aplastic anemia it will show few new blood cells being formed. Examining the bone marrow also helps distinguish aplastic anemia from other bone marrow disorders, such as myelodysplastic disorder or leukemia. Staging Classif...'

aS'The autoimmune hemolytic anemias are rare disorders characterized by the premature destruction (hemolysis) of red blood cells at a rate faster than they can be replaced. Acquired hemolytic anemias are non-genetic in origin. Idiopathic acquired autoimmune diseases occur when the body\'s natural defenses against invading organisms (e.g., lymphocytes, antibodies) destroy its own healthy tissues for no known reason. Normally, the red blood cells (erythrocytes) have a life span of approximately 120 days before being removed by the spleen. The severity of this type of anemia is determined by the life span of the red blood cell and by the rate at which these cells are replaced by the bone marrow. Clinicians are able to determine quite accurately (Coombs test) whether or not red blood cells are carrying with them chemicals that are being incorrectly recognized as an "enemy" and therefore subject to autoimmune destruction. Acquired autoimmune hemolytic anemia is a disorder that occurs in individuals who previously had a normal red blood cell system. The disorder may occur as the result of, or in conjunction with, some other medical condition, in which case it is "secondary" to another disorder. Less commonly, it occurs alone without a precipitating factor.Acquired autoimmune hemolytic anemia occurs in different forms, including warm antibody hemolytic anemia and cold antibody hemolytic anemia. In warm antibody hemolytic anemia, the self-generated antibodies (autoantibodies) attach themselves and cause the destruction of the red blood cells at temperatures above normal body temperature. In contrast, in the cases of cold antibody hemolytic anemia, the self-generated antibodies (autoantibodies) attach themselves and cause the destruction of the red blood cells at temperatures below normal body temperature.

aS"Sickle cell anemia is an inherited blood disorder. Its main symptoms are long-term (chronic) anemia and episodes of pain. In the disorder, hemoglobin molecules in the red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout the body, are defective. These defective molecules cause some of the red blood cells to change and form a sickle shape. These abnormally-shaped blood cells are the source of the anemia and pain. Sickle cell anemia occurs worldwide Sickle cell anemia is common among people whose ancestors come from sub-Saharan Africa, Spanish speaking regions of the world (South America, Cuba, and Central America), Saudi Arabia, India, and Mediterranean countries such as Turkey, Sicily, Greece, and Italy. Once thought to be a rare disease, research now shows that in the United States, sickle cell anemia occurs in about 1 in every 500 African-American children born and in 1 in every 900 Hispanic American children born. Passing on the gene to children Approximately 2 million Americans carry the defective gene for sickle cell anemia but do not themselves have the disease. However, if two people with the defective gene marry, there is a one in four chance that any child they have would have sickle cell anemia. Diagnosis Most states in the U.S. perform a simple blood test on all babies born to detect sickle cell anemia. If the test shows the abnormal hemoglobin is present, a second blood test is done to confirm the diagnosis. Symptoms Pain: The sickle-shaped red blood cells are sticky and have trouble passing through small blood vessels in the body. The cells get stuck, clump together, and block the flow of blood. Blocking off the blood causes pain. This is called a sickle cell crisis. Anemia: The sickle-shaped red blood cells die quickly. There are then not enough red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout the body. The result is fatigue, paleness, and shortness of breath. Delayed growth: Anemia slows the rate of growth because the body's cells don't get the oxygen they need to..."

aS'Sickle Cell Anemia Sickle Cell Disease Wednesday, 02 July 2003 Last Updated Wednesday, 04 February 2004 What Sickle cell anemia is an inherited blood disorder in which the oxygen-carrying substance of red blood cells (called hemoglobin) is different from the common form. In normal red blood cells oxygen is carried by hemoglobin A, and these cells are smooth and doughnut-shaped. In those with sickle cell anemia oxygen is carried by hemoglobin S and these cells become stiff, sticky, and sickle-shaped once they deliver oxygen to the tissues of the body. Because of their odd shape the sickled-cells often clump together and get stuck in the blood vessels, or break apart. Since red blood cells are important for delivering oxygen throughout the body, many organs can become starved for oxygen, which may cause episodes of pain, damage and under-development of many organs. Also, since the red blood cells break apart, a low red blood cell count (anemia) usually results. Who Sickle cell anemia affects millions of people throughout the world, including those whose ancestors are from sub-Saharan Africa, Latin American countries such as Cuba, South America and Central America, Saudi Arabia, India, and Mediterranean countries such as Italy and Greece. In the United States it affects about 72,000 people, mostly African American (1 in 500) and Hispanic Americans (1 in 1000 to 1400). Signs and Symptoms : The symptoms of sickle cell anemia vary from person to person and can range from mild to severe. The common problem among all people with sickle cell anemia is the rigid, sickle-shaped red blood cells that clog the blood vessels and prevent the delivery of oxygen to tissues of the body. The most common symptom therefore is pain. Other symptoms may include: jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin): due to the build up of Heme (found inside of red blood cells) in the blood from the breaking apart of red blood cells.

aS"Congenital Sideroblastic Anemia X-linked Sideroblastic Anemia, Hereditary Iron-Utilization Anemia Monday, 18 August 2003 Last Updated Sunday, 28 November 2004 What The sideroblastic anemias are a group of rare blood disorders characterized by the bone marrow's inability to manufacture normal red blood cells. The main defect is a failure of red blood cell (RBC) precursors to use iron in hemoglobin synthesis, despite the availability of adequate iron stores. As a result, iron is deposited in these RBC precursors forming the characteristic ringed sideroblast as seen under a microscope (sidero, meaning iron, and blast, meaning a precursor or an early germ cell that is still able to differentiate). The iron deposits are damaging to the cell, causing sideroblasts to develop poorly, if at all, into mature red cells. These factors along with the defective production of hemoglobin, a molecule that carries oxygen in the blood, results in anemia. Anemia (literally means lacking blood) simply indicates a decrease in RBCs in the blood. This is usually measured by a decrease in hemoglobin and can result in paleness, fatigue, and breathlessness due to the decrease in oxygen transport. There are two main types of sideroblastic anemia: congenital (inherited) or acquired. congenital sideroblastic anemia (CSA) is the focus of this article and is usually inherited through a mutation of a gene on the X chromosome, making it an X-linked disorder. Who congenital sideroblastic anemia is very rare and only several hundred cases have been reported worldwide. It disproportionately affects males because it takes only one abnormal X chromosome for males to develop disease. The age of disease onset can be variable- some children develop anemia within a few months of life while others may not have symptoms until 7 or 8 years-old. Females with one copy of an affected X chromosome show no signs of disease and are termed silent carriers. There are a few patients who develop sideroblastic anemia as p..."

aS'Pernicious anemia is a rare blood disorder characterized by the inability of the body to properly utilize vitamin B12, which is essential for the development of red blood cells. Most cases result from the lack of the gastric protein known as intrinsic factor, without which vitamin B12 cannot be absorbed. The symptoms of pernicious anemia may include weakness, fatigue, an upset stomach, an abnormally rapid heartbeat (tachycardia), and/or chest pains. Recurring episodes of anemia (megaloblastic) and an abnormal yellow coloration of the skin (jaundice) are also common. Pernicious anemia is thought to be an autoimmune disorder, and certain people may have a genetic predisposition to this disorder.There is a rare congenital form of pernicious anemia in which babies are born lacking the ability to produce effective intrinsic factor. There is also a juvenile form of the disease, but pernicious anemia typically does not appear before the age of 30. The onset of the disease is slow and may span decades. When the disease goes undiagnosed and untreated for a long period of time, it may lead to neurological complications. Nerve cells and blood cells need vitamin B12 to function properly.'

In this condition, there are low levels of iron in the body due to the destruction of the red blood cells (RBC) that normally carry oxygen to the bodys tissues. Who Approximately half of all cases of autoimmune hemolytic anemia have unknown causes. In children 2-12 years of age, the disease is much more likely to be acute (short lived, i.e. 3-6 months). The disorder is preceded by a cold or flu in many cases, and this vial infection is thought to trigger the disorder. In infants, older children and adults, autoimmune hemolytic anemia is often a chronic condition, lasting months to years. Signs and Symptoms In children with autoimmune hemolytic anemia any of the following signs and symptoms may be found: Fatigue Pale skin color Yellow skin color (jaundice) Shortness of breath Rapid heartbeat Dark urine The following laboratory study results may be found: A positive Coombs test. This is a test for antibodies against RBCs. Increased levels of bilirubin levels. bilirubin is the by-product of the destruction of old RBCs. With increased RBC destruction, there will be increased levels of bilirubin. The increased bilirubin is the cause of the yellowish skin color referred to as jaundice, and the dark urine, which is due to bilirubin breakdown products in the urine. Elevated levels of reticulocytes. Reticulocytes are the precursors to RBCs. The levels are increased because the body is trying to rapidly replace the destroyed cells. Low red blood cell count Low hemoglobin levels These signs and symptoms usually have a relatively sudden onset, appearing over a few days. Possible Causes In approximately half of all autoimmune hemolytic anemia cases, the condition is classified as idiopathic, meaning the cause is unknown.

aS'"Hemolytic anemia due to red cell pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is a metabolic disorder characterized by a variable degree of chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. PK deficiency is the most frequent cause of congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia with a prevalence estimated at 1/20,000 in the general white population. Clinically, PK-deficient patients suffer from a highly variable degree of chronic hemolysis, ranging from severe neonatal jaundice and fatal anemia at birth, severe transfusion-dependent chronic hemolysis, moderate hemolysis with exacerbation during infection, to a fully compensated hemolysis without apparent anemia. Chronic icterus, gallstones and splenomegaly are common findings. Erythrocyte PK deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the <i>PKLR</i> gene (1q22). To date, more than 190 mutations in <i>PKLR</i> have been reported. PK is a key regulatory enzyme of glycolysis and two major metabolic abnormalities result from PK deficiency: ATP depletion and increased 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) content. The precise mechanisms that cause extravascular hemolysis are as yet unknown, but an important feature involves the selective sequestration of PK-deficient young red blood cells, in particular reticulocytes, by the spleen. The increased 2,3-DPG levels ameliorate the anemia by lowering the oxygen-affinity of hemoglobin. Diagnosis may be considered on the basis of the clinical features and laboratory findings: a variable degree of anemia, reticulocytosis, increased non-conjugated bilirubin, and decreased levels of haptoglobin. Red blood cell morphology is essentially normal. PK deficiency is diagnosed by measuring PK enzymatic activity. Importantly, due to the fact that the enzymatic activity is red cell age-dependent, a deficiency of PK may be masked by reticulocytosis. Confirmation of the diagnosis requires molecular characterization. Secondary PK deficiency has also been reported, occurring in the context of hema...'

Symptoms Blackfan Diamond anemia is present at birth but can be difficult to identify. In about one-third of children born with the disorder, there are physical defects such as hand deformities or heart defects, but a clear set of signs hasn\'t been identified. The symptoms may also vary greatly, from very mild to severe and life-threatening. Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body, so a child with Blackfan Diamond may have symptoms related to not enough blood oxygen (anemia): pallor (paleness) irregular heartbeat, due to the heart trying to keep oxygen moving throughout the body fatigue, irritability, and fainting. Diagnosis Blackfan Diamond anemia is usually diagnosed within the first two years of life, sometimes even at birth, based on symptoms. For example, a baby might be suspected of having anemia if he or she is always pale and gets short of breath when drinking a bottle or nursing. Parents often suspect there is "something wrong" with their child. The diagnosis of Blackfan Diamond anemia in particular might not be recognized right away, though, because the disorder is rare and not all physicians are familiar with it. A complete blood cell count (CBC) for the baby would show a very low number of red blood cells as well as low hemoglobin. Another blood test would show high adenosine deaminase activity (ADA).

Thus, with defective hemoglobin, RBC production is also impaired and the RBC's are unable to carry the necessary amount of oxygen. hemoglobin is made of two different proteins, an alpha chain and a beta chain. Beta Thalassemia is more common and results when there is a defect in production of the beta chain, whereas Alpha Thalassemia is a defect in the alpha chain production. The severity of thalassemia depends on the number of chains that are defective. Who Thalassemia can affect anyone but is more common in certain regions of the world. Beta Thalassemia is more common in Italians, Greeks, and Southeast Asians (Vietnamese, Laotian). Alpha Thalassemia is more common in people who live in Africa, the Middle East, India, Southeast Asia, southern China, and occasionally the Mediterranean region.

aS'Megaloblastic anemia is a condition in which the bone marrow produces unusually large, structurally abnormal, immature red blood cells (megaloblasts). Bone marrow, the soft spongy material found inside certain bones, produces the main blood cells of the body -red cells, white cells, and platelets. Anemia is a condition characterized by the low levels of circulating, red blood cells. Red blood cells are released from the marrow into the bloodstream where they travel throughout the body delivering oxygen to tissue.
